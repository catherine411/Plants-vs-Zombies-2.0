ISU README File

Any functionalities missing from your original plan for the game
- Did not get the Cherry bomb to work - suppose to clear its row of zombies
- Cannot drag and drop icons from sidebar
- No progression tracker (the player would play until a zombie hits the opposite and end as the rate of zombies generated increases)
- Cannot detect collision between sunflower and zombies

Known bugs / errors in the game
- Collision detection between peashooter and walnut is not always accurate (especially for walnut, zombie may pause in the wrong column)
- when the peashooter is too close to the zombie, peas might shoot really quickly
- Zombie doesn't always stop when colliding with a peashooter
