# Plants-vs-Zombies-2.0


Based on the popular mobile game, Plants vs Zombies 2.0 is a single-player arcade-type game where the player takes the role of a homeowner in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. The aim of the player is to protect their home from a horde of zombies as they approach it along several parallel lanes.

The player defends the home by putting down plants (i.e. peashooters), which in turn fire projectiles (in a straight line) at the zombies and after several shots the zombie dies and cannot advance forwards.

There will be a brief time period before the game for the player to plant the plants before zombies start approaching. The player also has to collect a currency called “sun” throughout the game (that falls from the sky or is supplied by sunflowers - a powerup) in order to buy plants and powerups (like wall-nuts, cherry bombs etc.) to help them with the game.

If zombies make it to the house (opposite end of the screen) on any lane, the game will end and the player will have to restart it.
